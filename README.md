# GitHub Pages Profile — Single Page

This is a minimal single-page profile site intended for GitHub Pages. Replace the placeholders in `index.html` with your name, links, and contact info.

How to publish

1. Create a repo named `your-username.github.io` (replace `your-username`).
2. Commit these files and push to the `main` branch of that repo.
3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io` after GitHub builds the site.

Quick commands

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-username.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
```

Notes

- Edit `index.html` to add your real projects and contact details.
- You can also publish from any branch via the repository Settings → Pages.
